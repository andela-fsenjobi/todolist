# TodoApp with Ruby on Rollerskates

This is a sample todo app (and blog, you may add) that makes use of the Rollerskates MVC framework built with ruby. It works very much like rails only that you can't generate files just yet.

TO get started with this you may go through the documentation of here: [Rollerskates on Github](https://github.com/andela-fsenjobi/rollerskates) or simply clone this app to get started.

Have fun!
